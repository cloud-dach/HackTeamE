Mobile Backend (Node.js) for GeoPix App

GeoPix is a sample application leveraging IBM MobileFirst for Bluemix to capture data and images on a mobile device.  Persist that data locally, and replicate that data to the cloud.  Since it's built with IBM MobileFirst, we get lots of things out of the box, including operational analytics, user authentication, and much more.
